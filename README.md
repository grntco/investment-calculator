#Long-Term Games Investment Calculator

This is one of my first project ideas when I first learned to code.

The idea is simple: I love projecting investments over time and to see how they compound, but the website I did this with (calculator.net/investment-calculator) isn't exactly the prettiest site in the world. There's a lot going on, and I just wanted to project the return on an initial principal amount plus on monthly contributions.

So, this project is my solution: a well-designed, single-purpose investment calculator that only does one thing.

The design is heavily inspired from the artwork of Visualize Value (visualizevalue.com), which I first came across while reading the Almanack of Naval Ravikant. Speaking of Naval, I thought it would be a fun challenge to populate a random quote about long-term thinking/compound interest whenever the page is loaded.
